    Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheets. It adds all of the styles it needs for the
    presentation to work.
    This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
    classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
    you to use them directly in your presentation.
    Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
    do we?
    When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
will also get fallback styles.
When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
be removed.
The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.

        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        It will not be rotated or scaled.

                STOP for the love of kittens documenting server information/inventory outside of your project.
                Add an alias file. It's trivial, it lives in code so developers don't waste time searching
                for documentation and credentials.

            <ul>
                <li>Drupal.org has structure that allows you to download any version of a project including
                    dev and beta releases that drush hooks into.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine with drush make to get the correct release with the patches you
                    need.

                Rob Lowe. use php-cli.ini

            <h4>What developers are missing.</h4>
            <p>The first and biggest thing is writing code over and over again.(yes I'm starting in drush contrib).<br>
                <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/module_builder">
                    https://www.drupal.org/project/module_builder

                and for Drupal 8 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/console">
                    https://www.drupal.org/project/console
                </a>(not drush, works the same though)

            <h4>Export config from multiple environment using ctools and features. Don't wait for 'status' of
                a feature.
            </h4>
            <p>Large sites with lots of features are slow to work with. Features UI is PAINFULLY slow.</p>
            <p>Everytime you navigate to see the status of your feature it can take minutes per load. This
            can very easily add to hours of overhead when troubleshooting configuration.</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">drush @sitename.local features-diff feature_name</pre>

        <div class="step slide" data-x="8000">
            <h4>Another example: I need to recreate code that is over several features!</h4>
            Without drush:
            <ul>
                <li>Wait for features page to show status, find overridden.</li>
                <li>Click recreate/download</li>
                <li>Repeat x times</li>

            With drush and nix magic (probably want to alias this one):

sed -E 's/[[:space:]]*Enabled[[:space:]]*Overridden[[:space:]]*//' \ |
sed -E 's/.*[[:space:]]//' \| xargs drush fd
            </pre>
            This line of code has saved me personally hundreds of hours. You wouldn't believe how much time waiting
            for feature status can eat away 1-2 minutes at a time.

            <p>Don't make your CI a collection of scripts for different servers. It's a mess.Remember this?</p>

            <p>Notice the second alias? no .env prefix, push your database to all environments/masters/slaves in one go
            drush aliases have hierarchy which allows you to deploy to sub/supersets depending on how you configure.</p>
